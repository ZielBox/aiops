# AIOps

This repository contains various IT infrastructure related algorithms so that companies can use such scripts/code with simple steps in their organization.
We will covering algorightms like Anamoly Detection,Capacity Prediction, Failure or Reliability Prediction algorithms.

NOTES: 
We will be using Python for all our algorithms only.
Each Ops domain will have its own folder.

sample-data - Will contiain various sample data for testing of algos.
algorithms - Will contain actual alog code.
